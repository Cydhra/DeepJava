# DeepJava

A project containing compileable, but strange Java Source Code (Java 8 Compiler required). If you are using an IDE, it might
tell you, that some of the classes are not compileable. This is bullshit, but they do not really stand a chance.
I started this as a troll toa friend, who gave a tutorial at university. Then I discovered more and more valid, but
weird or just obfuscated Java constructions and started to add them together.

This project contains multiple runnable Java applications. One package always contains one application.

Regarding the class file ```Drivable.java```: Try to guess the terminal output on System.out and System.err each. (To be fair:
it is impossible, if you do not already know one specific method, I used in the example, but all other code snippets in the
file just follow weird Java specifications and behaviour)
