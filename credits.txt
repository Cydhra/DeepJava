SPOILER WARNING:
If you look at the credited websites, you may see some of the code constructions and what they do. If you
want to riddle yourself, what the applications do, do not look at the credits first!


The random generator method was taken from here (although it is commonly known and this is probably not its origin):

The idea with the multicast - calculation is also from there.
